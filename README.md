# MMD Tools

## Description

Certain models come with duplicate "special" `Display Frames` and these frames; Root and 表情 cannot be deleted.

The duplicates do not appear to negatively affect the model but sometimes show up in the middle of the Display tab in PMX Editor and cannot be moved.

This tool will allow you to rename and/or delete such frames.

The UI is mostly copied from PMX Editor to make it easier to use.
